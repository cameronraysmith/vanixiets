# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Initial Status (before completion):
#   - required: Must be completed to progress
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - recommended: Strongly suggested but not required
#   - conditional: Required only if certain conditions met (e.g., if_has_ui)
#
# Completion Status:
#   - {file-path}: File created/found (e.g., "docs/product-brief.md")
#   - skipped: Optional/conditional workflow that was skipped

  # Phase 3: Solutioning
  architecture-review: docs/notes/clan/integration-plan.md  # Current architecture documented
  integration-planning: docs/notes/clan/integration-plan.md  # Integration strategy documented
  create-architecture: deferred  # DEFERRED: Run after Phase 0 (Epic 1) validates integration patterns
  validate-architecture: optional
  solutioning-gate-check: deferred  # DEFERRED: Run after create-architecture completes

  # Phase 3.5: Epic Breakdown (non-standard sequencing for this project)
  # Running create-epics-and-stories before architecture due to Phase 0 validation requirement
  # Standard path: PRD → architecture → epics → sprint-planning
  # This project: PRD → epics → sprint-planning → execute Phase 0 → architecture → continue

  # Phase 4: Implementation
  sprint-planning: required  # Next: Creates sprint tracking from epic breakdown
