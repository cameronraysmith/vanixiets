## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Grounded vocabulary for behavioral requirements

The corpus SHALL provide one designation record per content term this repository's `behavioral`-stratum requirements use, recording the term, the sense in which it is used when a term carries more than one, the world phenomenon it denotes, and whether that phenomenon is world-only, shared with the machine, or machine-only.
A term found to denote two distinct phenomena within this repository's vocabulary SHALL be recorded as two rows rather than collapsed into one.

#### Scenario: The terms with two senses are read

- **WHEN** the table is read for terms that carry two senses in this repository
- **THEN** twenty-six terms carry more than one sense today and are disambiguated by separate rows rather than left to context: `session`, `package`, `policy`, `@`, `mutation`, `activation`, `probe`, `machine`, `host`, `interface`, `repository`, `build service`, `database`, `hostname`, `evaluator`, `person`, `writer`, `account`, `build`, `path`, `credential`, `identifier`, `browser`, `release`, `commit`, and `profile`, of which `probe` carries three and every other term two

#### Scenario: A term resolves to two phenomena

- **WHEN** a content term used in a behavioral requirement denotes two distinct phenomena within this repository's vocabulary
- **THEN** this designation table records both senses as separate rows rather than collapsing them into one

#### Scenario: A behavioral requirement uses an unlisted term

- **WHEN** the designation lint finds a content noun in a behavioral requirement that resolves to no row in this table
- **THEN** the noun is either added here as a world or shared phenomenon, or the requirement using it is redirected toward the interface stratum, and neither disposition is applied silently

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A84 — jj refuses to push a commit recorded while user.name was empty, until the commit is re-authored

It is true of jj at the release this fleet pins, 0.47.1, independent of what this fleet builds, that a commit recorded while `user.name` was empty, which empties both its author name and its committer name, is refused by `jj git push` with the error `no author and/or committer set`, and that the same commit remains refused after `user.name` is configured until it is explicitly re-authored.
Any requirement whose discharge depends on this fact SHALL name it explicitly, and SHALL be treated as losing its discharge once this assumption's violation condition below is observed.

**Evidence**: on 2026-11-08, in a throwaway colocated repository pushing to a local bare remote, jj 0.47.1 printed `Error: Won't push commit b89d28615160 since it has no author and/or committer set` for a commit recorded while `user.name` was empty, and printed the same error for the same commit after the push was retried with `user.name` configured; `jj metaedit --update-author` documents itself as updating a commit's author to the configured user.

#### Scenario: jj stops refusing such a commit, or stops refusing it once a name is configured

- **WHEN** a jj release pushes a commit recorded while `user.name` was empty, or pushes such a commit once `user.name` is configured without the commit having been re-authored
- **THEN** this assumption is void, and the `commit-author-identity` requirement `No commit is recorded with an empty author name` loses the argument that a commit recorded while `user.name` was empty is unpushable and the argument that such a commit must be re-authored before it can be pushed

### Requirement: A85 — Repository and environment author settings take precedence over account settings

It is true of git and jj at the releases this fleet pins, independent of what this fleet builds, that an author setting held in a process's environment (`GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` and `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL` for git, `JJ_USER` and `JJ_EMAIL` for jj) takes precedence over one held for the repository, and that one held for the repository (`git config --local`, `jj config set --repo`) takes precedence over one held for the account.
Any requirement whose discharge depends on this fact SHALL name it explicitly, and SHALL be treated as losing its discharge once this assumption's violation condition below is observed.

**Evidence**: on 2026-11-08, in a throwaway colocated repository with jj 0.47.1 and the fleet's git, `jj config get user.name` returned the repository value over the account value and `JJ_USER` over both, and `git config user.name` returned the `--local` value while `git var GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT` returned `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` over it; the email counterparts were not exercised and rest on the same precedence each tool documents.

#### Scenario: The precedence order changes

- **WHEN** a git or jj release lets an account-level author setting override a repository-level or environment one, or stops honoring one of those levels
- **THEN** this assumption is void, and the `commit-author-identity` requirement `A commit names the person it is recorded for` loses the argument that only a repository or environment author setting can displace the profile's author
