## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Grounded vocabulary for behavioral requirements

The corpus SHALL provide one designation record per content term this repository's `behavioral`-stratum requirements use, recording the term, the sense in which it is used when a term carries more than one, the world phenomenon it denotes, and whether that phenomenon is world-only, shared with the machine, or machine-only.
A term found to denote two distinct phenomena within this repository's vocabulary SHALL be recorded as two rows rather than collapsed into one.

#### Scenario: The terms with two senses are read

- **WHEN** the table is read for terms that carry two senses in this repository
- **THEN** twenty-two terms carry two senses today and are disambiguated by separate rows rather than left to context: `session`, `package`, `policy`, `@`, `mutation`, `activation`, `probe`, `machine`, `host`, `interface`, `repository`, `build service`, `database`, `hostname`, `evaluator`, `person`, `writer`, `account`, `build`, `path`, `credential`, and `identifier`

#### Scenario: A term resolves to two phenomena

- **WHEN** a content term used in a behavioral requirement denotes two distinct phenomena within this repository's vocabulary
- **THEN** this designation table records both senses as separate rows rather than collapsing them into one

#### Scenario: A behavioral requirement uses an unlisted term

- **WHEN** the designation lint finds a content noun in a behavioral requirement that resolves to no row in this table
- **THEN** the noun is either added here as a world or shared phenomenon, or the requirement using it is redirected toward the interface stratum, and neither disposition is applied silently

### Requirement: A13 — Resuming this laptop from a suspended state is unreliable, and recovering a failed resume requires a person at the machine

It is true of pyrite, this fleet's bare-metal Apple laptop, independent of its configuration, that a suspend sometimes never resumes, that only a control on the machine wakes it, and that it no longer suspends in use, falling silent instead by power-off, reboot or leaving the network.
Any requirement whose discharge depends on this fact SHALL name it explicitly, and SHALL be treated as losing its discharge once this assumption's violation condition below is observed.

**Evidence**: a host which entered a suspended state sometimes never ran again, measured at 7 failures against 30 successes across 14 boots, with no distinguishing record left behind and no identified mechanism, and the duration of the suspended interval did not predict which outcome occurred; its only remaining wake source is a physical control on the machine itself, so a host that fails to resume and a host that resumes without anyone present to press that control are indistinguishable from anywhere but the machine, an automatic suspend is a cost taken on behalf of a person who is by definition absent, and a deliberate suspend a cost taken by someone standing there; on 2026-10-27 its logind set `HandleLidSwitch=lock` and `HandleLidSwitchExternalPower=lock`, its last `systemd-suspend` entry across 75 journal boots was dated 2026-09-09, and on 2026-10-25 it booted seven times between 23:42 and 23:58 EDT (`journalctl -b all -u systemd-suspend.service` and `journalctl --list-boots` on pyrite; `logs/s4/brainstorm-prep.md` C4).

#### Scenario: Resume becomes reliable, or a wake source reachable from elsewhere appears

- **WHEN** this host is observed to resume from a suspended state across a run of attempts long enough to distinguish it from the recorded failure rate, or a wake source becomes available that a person not at the machine can trigger
- **THEN** this assumption is void, and the `graphical-desktop-session` requirement `The laptop does not suspend itself when nobody is using it` loses the reason it exists, becoming a preference about power use rather than an avoidance of a known harm

#### Scenario: pyrite suspends in use again

- **WHEN** pyrite's journal records `systemd-suspend` runs during ordinary use, or its lid switch suspends it again
- **THEN** this assumption is void for its silence, and the `fleet-alerting` requirement `A missing signal is itself reported` loses the argument that pyrite's silence comes from power-off, reboot or leaving the network, on which its acceptance by taking pyrite offline rests

### Requirement: A42 — ntfy keeps a topic's messages for a week and returns a recent window to a poll

It is true of ntfy 2.28.0, independent of what this fleet builds, that it keeps each published message for the `cache-duration` it is given, which cinnabar sets to 168 hours, in a cache that survives a restart, and answers `GET /<topic>/json?poll=1&since=10m` with that topic's cached messages of the last 10 minutes.
Any requirement whose discharge depends on this fact SHALL name it explicitly, and SHALL be treated as losing its discharge once this assumption's violation condition below is observed.

**Evidence**: `cache-duration` defaults to 12h (`binwiederhier/ntfy` `docs/config.md:503`, `:2387`, read on `main` rather than the 2.28.0 tag), `modules/machines/nixos/cinnabar/ntfy.nix` sets it to `168h` by the operator's decision of 2026-11-01 (charter v24), and the NixOS module sets a persistent `cache-file`; a poll with `since=<duration>` returns the cached messages of that window (`docs/subscribe/api.md:239-261`); 2.29.0, newer than cinnabar's release, fixed `poll=1` missing messages for up to 40 s under bursts, which at one heartbeat a minute leaves the 10-minute window full; the dead-man's own `AlertEvaluatorSilent`, which a cache that stopped answering would raise falsely, and R9.3's acceptance step of stopping and restarting the evaluator are its monitors.

#### Scenario: ntfy stops returning recent messages to a poll

- **WHEN** ntfy on cinnabar keeps messages for less than 10 minutes, loses its cache on restart and is polled before a new heartbeat arrives, or answers `poll=1&since=10m` without the messages of that window
- **THEN** this assumption is void, and the `fleet-alerting` requirement `A silent evaluator is reported from another host` and the `fleet-alerting-interface` requirement `The dead-man on cinnabar polls the heartbeat topic after an anonymous-publish probe` lose the discharge argument that an empty poll means no heartbeat was published

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A50 — electrum, galena and scheelite exist only while provisioned on demand

It is true of the fleet's cloud hosts electrum, galena and scheelite, independent of what their configurations hold, that each exists only while the operator provisions it on demand and is destroyed afterwards, so most of the time it is configured but runs nowhere.
Any requirement whose discharge depends on this fact SHALL name it explicitly, and SHALL be treated as losing its discharge once this assumption's violation condition below is observed.

**Evidence**: the terranix machine tables set `enabled = false` for electrum (`modules/terranix/hetzner.nix:18`) and for galena and scheelite (`modules/terranix/gcp.nix:32`, `:40`), while cinnabar and magnetite are `enabled = true`; ADR-009's Context records the same split, and their absence from the `fleet` database's `count by (host_name) (system_memory_usage_bytes)` on 2026-10-27 is its monitor.

#### Scenario: One of them is provisioned to run permanently

- **WHEN** electrum, galena or scheelite is set to `enabled = true` in its terranix table, or runs for more than a week
- **THEN** this assumption is void for that host, and the `fleet-alerting` requirement `A missing signal is itself reported` and the `host-metrics-collection` requirement `Each agent host contributes its own signals to the telemetry store` lose the argument that its silence is normal and its signals unobserved, until it is added to the always-on hosts

### Requirement: A51 — pyrite's NVMe controller answers the SMART health log at the pinned smartmontools

It is true of pyrite's `APPLE SSD AP0512J` controller at firmware `16.14.01`, independent of what this fleet builds, that it answers smartmontools 7.5's NVMe health log, with its critical warning, spare, wear, media errors and temperature, to a reader allowed to open its controller device.
Any requirement whose discharge depends on this fact SHALL name it explicitly, and SHALL be treated as losing its discharge once this assumption's violation condition below is observed.

**Evidence**: `smartctl -j -H -A /dev/nvme0` with the store's smartmontools 7.5 exited 0 as root on pyrite on 2026-10-27, reporting `Critical Warning 0x00`, `Available Spare 90%`, `Available Spare Threshold 2%`, `Percentage Used 11%`, `Media and Data Integrity Errors 0` and `Temperature 32 Celsius` (`logs/s4/brainstorm-prep.md` §2); the exporter's own read after pyrite's deploy and `RuleSignalMissing` on `smartctl_device_critical_warning_total` are its monitors.

#### Scenario: The controller stops answering the health log

- **WHEN** a firmware update or a smartmontools bump leaves the store without pyrite's `smartctl_device_critical_warning_total` while pyrite reports its memory signal
- **THEN** this assumption is void, and the `host-metrics-collection` requirement `Each agent host contributes its own signals to the telemetry store` and the `fleet-alerting` requirement `Each known failure class on a host reaches a person as an alert` lose the discharge argument for pyrite's disk health, which `RuleSignalMissing` reports within 30 minutes

### Requirement: A52 — The collector answers back-pressure with a retryable refusal and keeps its persistent queue across an outage and a restart

It is true of `otelcol-contrib` 0.155.0, independent of what this fleet builds, that a receiver whose queue is full or whose memory limiter refuses answers HTTP 503, which its exporter retries, and that a `file_storage` queue keeps its items across an outage of the receiver and a restart of its collector.
Any requirement whose discharge depends on this fact SHALL name it explicitly, and SHALL be treated as losing its discharge once this assumption's violation condition below is observed.

**Evidence**: on magnetite on 2026-10-28 a spike ingress with a two-request queue toward an absent store, and then with a refusing limiter, answered `503` with `{"code":14,...}`, the agent logged `Will retry`, its queue grew from 28 to 59 requests across an outage and its own restart, and every one of the 783 points it scraped arrived once the ingress recovered, while the ingress counted the same points as refused and enqueue-failed (`logs/s4/grounding.md` §2); `vmTests.x86_64-linux.fleet-ingress`'s back-pressure case, run before any collector bump merges, is its monitor.

#### Scenario: A collector bump changes the refusal or the queue

- **WHEN** a collector version answers a full queue or a refusing limiter with a status its exporter treats as permanent, or loses persistent-queue items across a restart
- **THEN** this assumption is void, and the `host-metrics-collection` requirement `Collection survives a telemetry store restart without losing the queued interval` and the `fleet-ingress-interface` requirement `otel-envelope regulates each agent from its own collector` lose the argument that the ingress's refusals are back-pressure rather than loss
