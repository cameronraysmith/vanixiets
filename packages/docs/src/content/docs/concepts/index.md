Conceptual documentation to help you understand the architecture and design patterns used in this infrastructure.

## Architecture

- [Nix-Config Architecture](nix-config-architecture) - Four-layer architecture combining flake-parts, dendritic pattern, clan-core, and multi-channel overlays
- [Dendritic Architecture](dendritic-architecture) - Aspect-based module organization where every file is a flake-parts module
- [Clan Integration](clan-integration) - Multi-machine coordination, deployment, and service orchestration

## Patterns

- [Multi-User Patterns](multi-user-patterns) - Admin users with integrated home-manager vs standalone users
