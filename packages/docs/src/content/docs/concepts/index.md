Conceptual documentation to help you understand the architecture and design patterns used in this infrastructure.

## Architecture

- [Architecture overview](/concepts/architecture-overview/) - Four-layer architecture combining flake-parts, dendritic pattern, clan-core, and multi-channel overlays
- [Dendritic Architecture](/concepts/dendritic-architecture/) - Aspect-based module organization where every file is a flake-parts module
- [Clan Integration](/concepts/clan-integration/) - Multi-machine coordination, deployment, and service orchestration

## Patterns

- [System-user Integration](/concepts/system-user-integration/) - Admin users with integrated home-manager vs standalone users
