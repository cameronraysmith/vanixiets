# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic exists in epic file but not contexted
#   - contexted: Epic tech context created (required before drafting stories)
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - drafted: Story file created in stories folder
#   - ready-for-dev: Draft approved and story context created
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Under SM review (via code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - completed: Retrospective has been done
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epics should be 'contexted' before stories can be 'drafted'
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically drafts next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', SM reviews, then Dev moves to 'done'
#
# MIGRATION-SPECIFIC NOTES:
# =========================
# - This is a progressive rollout infrastructure migration with 6 phases (Phase 0-5)
# - Phase 0 includes INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENT (Hetzner + GCP VMs) in test-clan
# - Each phase includes: implementation + stability validation (1-2 weeks)
# - Stories within phases are largely sequential, not parallelizable
# - Each phase must reach stability gate before next phase begins
# - Phase 0 has a GO/NO-GO decision gate that determines entire migration approach
# - Primary workstation (stibnite) requires 4-6 weeks cumulative stability before migration
#
# STABILITY GATES:
# ================
# - Epic 1 (Story 1.14): GO/CONDITIONAL GO/NO-GO decision determines entire approach
# - Epic 1 (Story 1.12): Infrastructure stable 1 week minimum before Phase 1
# - Epic 2 (Story 2.6): cinnabar stable 1-2 weeks → proceed to blackphos
# - Epic 3 (Story 3.5): blackphos stable 1-2 weeks → proceed to rosegold
# - Epic 4 (Story 4.3): rosegold stable 1-2 weeks → proceed to argentum
# - Epic 5 (Story 5.2): argentum stable 1-2 weeks, cumulative 4-6+ weeks → proceed to stibnite
# - Epic 6 (Story 6.3): stibnite stable 1-2 weeks → proceed to cleanup
#
# ZERO-REGRESSION REQUIREMENT:
# ============================
# All functionality must be preserved during migration. Validate at every phase.

  # Epic 1: Architectural Validation + Infrastructure Deployment (Phase 0 - test-clan)
  # Strategic decision (2025-11-05): Story 1.2 complete (Outcome A) - implement test harness + dendritic refactoring NOW
  # Rationale: Test strategy enables risk-free refactoring, validates architecture during Phase 0, benefits Epic 2+
  # Flow: 1.1-1.5 (complete) → 1.6 (test harness) → 1.7 (dendritic refactor) → 1.8-1.14 (GCP + validation)

  # Story 1.6: DONE - Test harness implemented with 18 tests (12 nix-unit + 4 validation + 2 integration)
  # Implementation evolved to hybrid approach in modules/checks/ with auto-discovery (superior to original plan)

  # Story 1.7: DONE - Pure dendritic flake-parts pattern achieved with zero regressions

  # Story 1.8: DONE - Configuration build complete, APPROVED ✅
  # Successfully migrated blackphos to test-clan dendritic + clan pattern
  # AC1-AC4 complete: module structure, home-manager, clan inventory validated
  # AC5-AC7 deferred: physical deployment awaits access to blackphos hardware
  # Architectural gap identified: crs58/raquel configs inline (not reusable across platforms)
  # Course correction executed (2025-11-12): Story 1.8A inserted to restore modular pattern
  # Review outcome: APPROVE - All configuration objectives achieved, proper course correction

  # Story 1.8A: DONE ✅ - Extract Portable Home-Manager Modules (CRITICAL PATH)
  # Extracted crs58/raquel into portable modules (modules/home/users/{crs58,raquel}/)
  # Exported to dendritic namespace: flake.modules.homeManager."users/{username}"
  # Exposed standalone homeConfigurations.{crs58,raquel} for nh home switch workflow
  # Refactored blackphos to import from namespace (46 lines removed, zero regression validated)
  # Package diff: 270 packages preserved exactly, all functionality intact
  # Added test coverage: TC-018 (home-module-exports), TC-019 (home-configurations-exposed)
  # Pattern documented in architecture.md with validation evidence
  # Successfully unblocked Story 1.9: crs58 module ready for cinnabar NixOS reuse
  # Implementation time: ~2 hours, all 8 acceptance criteria satisfied

  # Story 1.9: DONE ✅ APPROVED ✅ - Rename test VMs to production names (cinnabar/electrum)
  # All 7 ACs validated: VMs renamed, clan inventory updated, zerotier network operational
  # Bidirectional connectivity confirmed (1-12ms latency), 14/14 tests passing
  # Zerotier network: db4344343b14b903 (cinnabar controller + electrum peer)
  # Key learning: clan machines update uploads vars but doesn't restart services

  # Story 1.10: DONE ✅ (2025-11-14) - Complete Migrations and Establish Clean Foundation
  # Split from original 1.10 to optimize sizing (10-15h vs 18-27h original)
  # Completes blackphos migration, deploys cameron user to cinnabar, refines dendritic patterns
  # Critical: cinnabar user config BLOCKS Story 1.12 (heterogeneous networking validation)
  # Foundation for Story 1.11 (type-safe home-manager architecture)
  # REVIEW #1 (2025-11-13): CHANGES REQUESTED - Technical excellent, documentation gaps (AC15-AC16)
  # IMPLEMENTATION: Created migration-patterns.md (424 lines), dendritic-patterns.md (651 lines), completed story notes
  # REVIEW #2 (2025-11-13): APPROVED ✅ - All CRITICAL gaps resolved, documentation exceeds requirements
  # 16/16 ACs satisfied, 7/7 tasks complete, production-ready documentation, zero regressions
  # User approved story-done (2025-11-14) - VPS deployment deferred to separate infrastructure task

  # Story 1.10A: IN-PROGRESS (2025-11-14) - Migrate User Management to Clan Inventory Pattern
  # DISCOVERED STORY - Architectural validation enhancement from party-mode review
  # Refactors cameron user from direct NixOS to clan inventory users service + vars
  # Validates clan-core pattern before Epic 2-6 scaling (6 machines × 4+ users)
  # Strategic value: 5-10x productivity improvement, saves 6-12 hours in Epic 2-6
  # Architectural findings: Inventory + vars proven at scale (pinpox: 8×3, mic92: 9 machines/128 secrets)
  # Builds on: Story 1.10 baseline (cameron user works via direct NixOS)
  # Enables: Story 1.11 type-safe architecture + Epic 2-6 fleet deployment
  # Estimated effort: 3-4 hours (1h instances + 1h removal + 1h vars + 0.5h tests + 0.5h docs)
  # Story context generated 2025-11-14 with comprehensive doc refs, code artifacts, proven patterns

  # Reference: docs/notes/development/home-manager-type-safe-architecture.md
  # Updated effort: 12-18 hours (9-14h architecture + 3-4h documentation)
