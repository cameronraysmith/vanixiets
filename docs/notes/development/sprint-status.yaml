# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic exists in epic file but not contexted
#   - contexted: Epic tech context created (required before drafting stories)
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - drafted: Story file created in stories folder
#   - ready-for-dev: Draft approved and story context created
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Under SM review (via code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - completed: Retrospective has been done
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epics should be 'contexted' before stories can be 'drafted'
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically drafts next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', SM reviews, then Dev moves to 'done'
#
# MIGRATION-SPECIFIC NOTES:
# =========================
# - This is a progressive rollout infrastructure migration with 6 phases (Phase 0-5)
# - Phase 0 includes INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENT (Hetzner + GCP VMs) in test-clan
# - Each phase includes: implementation + stability validation (1-2 weeks)
# - Stories within phases are largely sequential, not parallelizable
# - Each phase must reach stability gate before next phase begins
# - Phase 0 has a GO/NO-GO decision gate that determines entire migration approach
# - Primary workstation (stibnite) requires 4-6 weeks cumulative stability before migration
#
# STABILITY GATES:
# ================
# - Epic 1 (Story 1.12): GO/CONDITIONAL GO/NO-GO decision determines entire approach
# - Epic 1 (Story 1.10): Infrastructure stable 1 week minimum before Phase 1
# - Epic 2 (Story 2.6): cinnabar stable 1-2 weeks → proceed to blackphos
# - Epic 3 (Story 3.5): blackphos stable 1-2 weeks → proceed to rosegold
# - Epic 4 (Story 4.3): rosegold stable 1-2 weeks → proceed to argentum
# - Epic 5 (Story 5.2): argentum stable 1-2 weeks, cumulative 4-6+ weeks → proceed to stibnite
# - Epic 6 (Story 6.3): stibnite stable 1-2 weeks → proceed to cleanup
#
# ZERO-REGRESSION REQUIREMENT:
# ============================
# All functionality must be preserved during migration. Validate at every phase.

  # Epic 1: Architectural Validation + Infrastructure Deployment (Phase 0 - test-clan)
  # Strategic decision (2025-11-03): Infrastructure-first approach - defer Story 1.2 (dendritic)
