# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic exists in epic file but not contexted
#   - contexted: Epic tech context created (required before drafting stories)
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - drafted: Story file created in stories folder
#   - ready-for-dev: Draft approved and story context created
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Under SM review (via code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - completed: Retrospective has been done
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epics should be 'contexted' before stories can be 'drafted'
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically drafts next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', SM reviews, then Dev moves to 'done'
#
# MIGRATION-SPECIFIC NOTES:
# =========================
# - This is a progressive rollout infrastructure migration with 6 phases (Phase 0-5)
# - Phase 0 includes INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENT (Hetzner + GCP VMs) in test-clan
# - Each phase includes: implementation + stability validation (1-2 weeks)
# - Stories within phases are largely sequential, not parallelizable
# - Each phase must reach stability gate before next phase begins
# - Phase 0 has a GO/NO-GO decision gate that determines entire migration approach
# - Primary workstation (stibnite) requires 4-6 weeks cumulative stability before migration
#
# STABILITY GATES:
# ================
# - Epic 1 (Story 1.14): GO/CONDITIONAL GO/NO-GO decision determines entire approach
# - Epic 1 (Story 1.12): Infrastructure stable 1 week minimum before Phase 1
# - Epic 2 (Story 2.6): cinnabar stable 1-2 weeks → proceed to blackphos
# - Epic 3 (Story 3.5): blackphos stable 1-2 weeks → proceed to rosegold
# - Epic 4 (Story 4.3): rosegold stable 1-2 weeks → proceed to argentum
# - Epic 5 (Story 5.2): argentum stable 1-2 weeks, cumulative 4-6+ weeks → proceed to stibnite
# - Epic 6 (Story 6.3): stibnite stable 1-2 weeks → proceed to cleanup
#
# ZERO-REGRESSION REQUIREMENT:
# ============================
# All functionality must be preserved during migration. Validate at every phase.

  # Split from original 1.10 to optimize sizing (10-15h vs 18-27h original)
  # Completes blackphos migration, deploys cameron user to cinnabar, refines dendritic patterns
  # Critical: cinnabar user config BLOCKS Story 1.12 (heterogeneous networking validation)
  # Foundation for Story 1.11 (type-safe home-manager architecture)
  # REVIEW #1 (2025-11-13): CHANGES REQUESTED - Technical excellent, documentation gaps (AC15-AC16)
  # IMPLEMENTATION: Created migration-patterns.md (424 lines), dendritic-patterns.md (651 lines), completed story notes
  # REVIEW #2 (2025-11-13): APPROVED ✅ - All CRITICAL gaps resolved, documentation exceeds requirements
  # 16/16 ACs satisfied, 7/7 tasks complete, production-ready documentation, zero regressions
  # User approved story-done (2025-11-14) - VPS deployment deferred to separate infrastructure task
  1-10-complete-migrations-establish-clean-foundation: done
  # Story 1.10A: DONE ✅ APPROVED ✅ (2025-11-14) - Migrate User Management to Clan Inventory Pattern
  # DISCOVERED STORY - Architectural validation enhancement from party-mode review
  # Implementation: 3.5 hours across 11 atomic commits (846b61e-fa90429)
  # Pattern migration: Direct NixOS → clan inventory users service + vars-based password management
  # Two-instance pattern: user-cameron (modern machines), user-crs58 (legacy machines)
  # Functional validation COMPLETE: VPS deployment successful (cinnabar IP: 49.13.68.78)
  # Validated end-to-end: SSH login, shell (zsh), sudo, git config, home-manager packages
  # Post-review improvements: Critical SSH keys fix (6364610), home directory auto-detection (e629e8e)
  # Test suite: 10 checks passing (TC-024 vars validation added), zero regressions
  # Documentation: user-management.md (327 lines) + adding-users.md (436 lines)
  # REVIEW (2025-11-14): APPROVE - All 11 ACs implemented, 6/6 tasks verified, production-ready
  # Strategic value validated: Pattern ready for Epic 2-6 scaling (6 machines × 4+ users)
  # Estimated time savings: 6-12 hours in Epic 2-6 (inventory pattern vs direct config)
  1-10a-migrate-user-management-inventory: done
  # Story 1.10B: DONE ✅ (2025-11-14) - Migrate Home-Manager Module Ecosystem from infra to test-clan
  # DISCOVERED STORY - Configuration completeness gap via comprehensive blackphos audit
  # Implementation: 18 commits across 2 sessions (71dde62-d4ef3a2)
  # Priority 1-3 modules migrated (17 total): dev env (7) + AI tooling (4) + shell/terminal (6)
  # Pattern B implemented (underscore directories + plain HM modules)
  # CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL LIMITATIONS DISCOVERED (dev notes lines 767-1031):
  #   - 11 features DISABLED (SSH signing, MCP API keys, GLM wrapper, tmux theme, custom packages)
  #   - darwinConfigurations.blackphos.system FAILS TO BUILD (lazyvim integration broken)
  #   - No flake context access (plain modules cannot access flake.inputs, flake.config)
  #   - sops-nix completely incompatible (requires flake.config lookups)
  # Functional status: 85% (core functionality present, secrets/themes/packages disabled)
  # homeConfigurations.crs58/raquel build successfully, darwinConfigurations FAILS
  # Party Mode investigation (9 agents): UNANIMOUS refactor to Pattern A (both references use Pattern A)
  # Story 1.10BA inserted to refactor Pattern B → Pattern A before Story 1.10C
  # Strategic value: Provided empirical evidence that Pattern B is architectural dead end
  1-10b-migrate-home-manager-modules: done
  # Story 1.10BA: DONE (2025-11-14) - Refactor Home-Manager Modules from Pattern B to Pattern A
  # ✅ SCOPE ADJUSTED: Feature restoration (original AC17-AC20) moved to Story 1.10D
  # Structural Pattern A migration COMPLETE: All 16 modules use explicit flake.modules = { ... } pattern
  # Aggregate organization validated: development (7), ai (4), shell (6) following drupol reference
  # All 3 critical builds passing: crs58, raquel, blackphos (darwinConfigurations build FIXED)
  # Pattern A benefits validated: flake context access, aggregate namespaces, industry-standard
  # Actual effort: ~4 hours (vs 8-10h estimated - structural work only, features deferred to 1.10D)
  # Party Mode architectural review validated empirically
  # Feature restoration deferred rationale: test-clan uses clan vars (not sops-nix), requires Story 1.10C infrastructure first
  # Dependencies: Story 1.10B (done), Blocks: Story 1.10C (modules have flake context), Story 1.10D (deferred features)
  # Strategic value achieved: Validates Pattern A at scale, unblocks Story 1.10C, provides Epic 2-6 pattern
  1-10ba-refactor-pattern-a: done
  # Story 1.10C: DONE ✅ APPROVED ✅ (2025-11-16) - Establish sops-nix Secrets for Home-Manager
  # Secrets management gap identified - Story 1.8 deferred, Story 1.10 never addressed (0% secrets coverage)
  # ARCHITECTURAL PIVOT (2025-11-15): Clan vars INCOMPATIBLE with home-manager (NixOS-specific _class parameter)
  # Two-tier secrets architecture validated: System-level (clan vars, future) vs User-level (sops-nix, now)
  # sops-nix proven pattern for home-manager across infra + 8 clan reference repos
  # Age key reuse pattern: Same keypair for clan secrets AND sops-nix (~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt)
  # Implementation: 52 commits, sops.templates patterns, multi-user encryption, Pattern A integration
  # Module access pattern updates: git.nix, jujutsu.nix, mcp-servers.nix, wrappers.nix, atuin.nix, rbw.nix
  # REVIEW #1 (2025-11-16): CHANGES REQUESTED - AC4-AC21 complete, AC22-AC24 documentation missing
  # REVIEW FOLLOW-UP (2025-11-16): All requested changes complete
  # Build validation (AC16-AC18): All 3 builds PASSED (darwin, crs58, raquel)
  # Documentation (AC23): age-key-management.md created (882 lines, Epic 2-6 operational guide)
  # Documentation (AC22+AC24): Section 12 added to architecture doc (375 lines, two-tier secrets)
  # Secret count clarified: ssh-public-key INTENTIONAL (8 crs58, 5 raquel for allowed_signers template)
  # REVIEW #2 (2025-11-16): APPROVE ✅ - All 24 ACs satisfied, 7/7 tasks verified, builds passing, docs complete
  # Epic 2-6 readiness: 100% (code validated, builds passing, documentation complete, operational guide ready)
  # Actual effort: 7.25 hours total (4.75h implementation + 2.5h review follow-up) vs 4.75h estimated
  # Strategic value: Validates sops-nix + Pattern A, unblocks Epic 2-6 migration, documents two-tier architecture

  # Story 1.10D: READY-FOR-DEV (2025-11-16) - Validate Custom Package Overlays with pkgs-by-name Pattern
  # Epic reordering decision (2025-11-16): Infrastructure validation BEFORE feature enablement
  # Validates infra's custom package overlay pattern works with dendritic flake-parts + clan architecture
  # pkgs-by-name-for-flake-parts pattern from Dendritic Overlay Pattern Review (drupol PRIMARY reference)
  # Test case: ccstatusline (production-ready derivation from infra, settings pre-configured in test-clan)
  # 9 ACs: Infrastructure setup, package implementation, build validation, integration, documentation
  # Three-layer pattern: pkgs/by-name/ (definition) → modules/nixpkgs.nix (export) → dendritic modules (consumption)
  # infra migration: SAFE TO MIGRATE (directory restructuring only, 4 packages: ccstatusline, atuin-format, markdown-tree-parser, starship-jj)
  # Estimated effort: 2-3 hours (20min infra + 10min package + 1h validation + 1h15m docs)
  # Dependencies: Story 1.10C (sops-nix infrastructure), Dendritic Overlay Pattern Review (2025-11-16)
  # Blocks: Story 1.10E (ccstatusline feature enablement), Epic 1 checkpoint (overlay validation critical for GO decision)
  # Strategic value: Completes Epic 1 architectural coverage (95%), removes Epic 2-6 migration blocker (overlay uncertainty)

  # Story 1.10E: RENAMED (2025-11-16) - Enable Remaining Features Using sops-nix Secrets and Flake Inputs
  # Previously Story 1.10D (2025-11-14), renamed during epic reordering to resolve dependency on ccstatusline package
  # Story 1.10C already enabled 9/11 features (sops-nix patterns: direct path, sops.placeholder, runtime cat, activation scripts)
  # Remaining scope: Add flake.inputs (nix-ai-tools, catppuccin-nix), enable claude-code package, catppuccin theme, ccstatusline feature
  # Category A (5 secrets): ✅ COMPLETE in Story 1.10C (SSH signing, MCP firecrawl/huggingface, context7 N/A)
  # Category B (3 packages): ✅ GLM wrapper complete (Story 1.10C), ❌ claude-code (Story 1.10E), ❌ ccstatusline (Story 1.10D+1.10E)
  # Category C (3 themes): ❌ catppuccin tmux theme (Story 1.10E, flake.inputs blocked)
  # 8 ACs: Review 1.10C implementations (A-C), enable claude-code (D), catppuccin theme (E), ccstatusline feature (F), builds (G), docs Section 13 (H)
  # Estimated effort: 1.5-2 hours (30min flake.inputs + 15min claude-code + 45min catppuccin + 15min ccstatusline + 30min builds + 30min docs)
  # Dependencies: Story 1.10C (sops-nix, 9/11 features), Story 1.10D (ccstatusline package)
