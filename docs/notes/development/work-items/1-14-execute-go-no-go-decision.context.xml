  <acceptanceCriteria>
    AC1: Decision Framework Evaluation Documented - Evaluate ALL 7 Epic 1 validation criteria (infrastructure deployment, dendritic pattern, nix-darwin integration, heterogeneous networking, transformation pattern, home-manager integration, pattern confidence) with explicit PASS/FAIL determinations and evidence citations from Stories 1.1-1.13

    AC2: Blockers Identified (If Any) - Conduct exhaustive blocker assessment across CRITICAL/MAJOR/MINOR severity levels, reviewing all Epic 1 stories, Story 1.13 integration findings, Story 1.12 physical deployment, test suite results, and documentation completeness

    AC3: Decision Rendered - Formalize GO/CONDITIONAL GO/NO-GO decision based on AC1 evaluation and AC2 blocker assessment with explicit rationale and evidence traceability

    AC4: If GO/CONDITIONAL GO: Production Refactoring Plan Confirmed - Validate Epic 2-6 plan documented, migration pattern components ready for infra application, test-clan configs ready to migrate, blackphos management decision made

    AC5: If NO-GO: Alternative Approaches Documented - Document alternative architectures (nixos-unified, hybrid, extended validation), issues requiring resolution, timeline for retry/pivot, specific validation gaps

    AC6: Next Steps Clearly Defined Based on Decision Outcome - Define immediate actions conditional on GO (sprint planning, Epic 2 kickoff, success metrics), CONDITIONAL GO (conditions tracking, re-evaluation), or NO-GO (halt planning, resolution work, stakeholder communication)

  <tests>
    <standards>
      Story 1.14 is Decision/Review Framework - NOT implementation story. Testing focuses on decision document validation, evidence traceability, and decision logic soundness rather than code tests.

      Validation Approach:
      1. Decision document completeness: All ACs (AC1-AC6) addressed with required sections
      2. Evidence citation traceability: Every PASS determination references specific Story 1.x deliverable, file path, test result
      3. Decision logic soundness: GO/CONDITIONAL GO/NO-GO based on explicit criteria (AC1 evaluation + AC2 blocker assessment)
      4. Next steps actionability: Epic 2 transition OR resolution work well-defined and executable
      5. Sprint status accuracy: Updates match decision outcome (Story 1.14 done, Epic 1 done if GO, Epic 2 contexted if GO)

      Epic 1 Test Suite Evidence (for AC1.2 dendritic pattern validation):
      - test-clan test harness (Story 1.6): 18 tests total (12 nix-unit + 4 validation + 2 integration)
      - Auto-discovery functional (import-tree validates module structure)
      - Zero regressions (all tests passing after Story 1.7 dendritic refactoring)
      - Location: ~/projects/nix-workspace/test-clan/modules/checks/ (nix-unit.nix, integration.nix, validation.nix)

      Build Validation Evidence (for AC1.3 darwin integration, AC1.6 home-manager feature parity):

      <!-- AC1 Decision Framework Evaluation Validation -->
      <test id="AC1-validation" ac="AC1">
        Validate decision framework evaluation completeness:
        - ALL 7 criteria assessed (AC1.1 infrastructure, AC1.2 dendritic, AC1.3 darwin, AC1.4 heterogeneous, AC1.5 transformation, AC1.6 home-manager, AC1.7 pattern confidence)
        - Each criterion has explicit PASS/FAIL determination
        - Each PASS cites specific Story 1.x evidence (deliverable, file path, test result, deployment log)
        - Each confidence level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) has rationale tied to Epic 1 validation scope
        - Pattern confidence summary table includes all 7 patterns (dendritic, clan, terraform, sops-nix, zerotier, home-manager, overlays)
      </test>

      <!-- AC2 Blocker Assessment Validation -->
      <test id="AC2-validation" ac="AC2">
        Validate blocker assessment exhaustiveness:
        - Methodology documented (how exhaustive search conducted across Epic 1 stories, Story 1.13 findings, Story 1.12 deployment, test suite, documentation)
        - Blockers classified by severity (CRITICAL/MAJOR/MINOR using AC2 definitions)
        - If zero blockers: exhaustive search process documented to prove absence, not oversight
        - Blocker summary table includes count, severity, production readiness assessment
      </test>

      <!-- AC3 Decision Rendering Validation -->
      <test id="AC3-validation" ac="AC3">
        Validate decision rendering logic:
        - Decision outcome (GO/CONDITIONAL GO/NO-GO) follows explicit criteria from AC3
        - GO decision: Validates ALL AC1 PASS + zero CRITICAL/MAJOR blockers
        - CONDITIONAL GO decision: Validates MOST AC1 PASS + documented workarounds for MAJOR blockers
        - NO-GO decision: Validates ANY AC1 FAIL OR 1+ CRITICAL blocker identified
        - Decision rationale explicitly ties to AC1 evaluation results + AC2 blocker assessment
        - Evidence traceability complete (every decision point references specific Epic 1 validation)
      </test>

      <!-- AC4 Transition Plan Validation (if GO/CONDITIONAL GO) -->
      <test id="AC4-validation" ac="AC4">
        Validate GO/CONDITIONAL GO transition plan completeness:
        - Epic 2-6 plan validated (all 6 epics documented, stories enumerated, effort estimated, machine sequence confirmed)
        - Migration pattern components identified (Story 1.13 migration-patterns.md, architecture guides, deployment checklists, operational guides)
        - test-clan configs readiness confirmed (cinnabar, electrum, portable home modules crs58/raquel/cameron, secrets structure)
        - Blackphos management decision made (Option A revert to infra OR Option B keep in test-clan with rationale)
        - Epic 2 immediate next steps defined (Story 2.1-2.6 sequence, timeline, success metrics)
      </test>

      <!-- AC6 Next Steps Validation -->
      <test id="AC6-validation" ac="AC6">
        Validate next steps actionability based on decision outcome:
        - IF GO: Immediate actions defined (sprint planning update, Epic 1 retrospective, Epic 2 Story 2.1 preparation), Epic 2 kickoff sequence (Story 2.1-2.6), success metrics (cinnabar deployed, dendritic+clan applied, zerotier operational, stability gate)
        - IF CONDITIONAL GO: Conditions tracking defined (conditions.md creation, mitigation strategies, re-evaluation checkpoints)
        - IF NO-GO: Resolution work defined (halt Epic 2-6 planning, resolution stories Epic 1.15-1.16, stakeholder communication, retry timeline)
        - Next steps executable without ambiguity
      </test>

      <!-- Sprint Status Update Validation -->
      <test id="sprint-status-validation" ac="Task 8">
        Validate sprint-status.yaml updates match decision outcome:
        - Story 1.14 status updated: backlog → done (always, regardless of decision)
        - IF GO: Epic 1 status updated: backlog → done (Epic 1 complete milestone)
        - IF GO: Epic 2 status updated: backlog → contexted (ready for story drafting)
        - ALL comments and STATUS DEFINITIONS structure preserved in sprint-status.yaml
        - Story key 1-14-execute-go-no-go-decision found and updated correctly
      </test>

      <!-- Evidence Traceability Audit -->
      <test id="evidence-traceability" ac="AC1+AC3">
        Audit evidence traceability across decision document:
        - Every AC1 PASS determination cites specific evidence location (Story 1.x, file path, line range when applicable)
        - Example citations validate: "Story 1.7 completion, test suite passing (18/18 tests), zero regression validation per test harness results"
        - Pattern confidence assessments tie to specific stories: "Dendritic flake-parts confidence HIGH - Stories 1.1, 1.6-1.7 validation, test harness continuous validation"
        - No speculative assessments (all claims backed by Epic 1 deliverable evidence)
