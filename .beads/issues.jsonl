{"id":"nix-50f.14","title":"nixidy local cluster integration","description":"## Objective\n\nConfigure nixidy for local-k3d environment and generate ArgoCD Application CRs that adopt Phase 3 infrastructure while enabling Phase 4 GitOps management. This bridges the kluctl-deployed infrastructure to ArgoCD's declarative Application model.\n\n## Scope\n\nFiles to create:\n- `kubernetes/nixidy/default.nix` - nixidy flake entry point\n- `kubernetes/nixidy/envs/local-k3d/default.nix` - local environment configuration\n- `kubernetes/nixidy/apps/bootstrap.nix` - App-of-Apps root Application\n- `kubernetes/nixidy/apps/cilium.nix` - adoption Application for Cilium\n- `kubernetes/nixidy/apps/sops-secrets-operator.nix` - adoption Application for sops-operator\n- `kubernetes/nixidy/apps/step-ca.nix` - adoption Application for step-ca\n- `kubernetes/nixidy/apps/argocd.nix` - adoption Application for ArgoCD (self-management)\n\nOutput directory:\n- `./manifests/local-k3d/` - rendered Application CRs (gitignored, generated by nixidy)\n\nConfiguration requirements:\n- Git repository source: this repository's URL\n- Target revision: current branch or `HEAD`\n- Sync waves: CRDs at -2, operators at -1, CRs at 0\n- Adoption-safe sync options:\n  - `ServerSideApply=true` - merge with existing resources\n  - `ApplyOutOfSyncOnly=true` - skip resources already matching desired state\n- ignoreDifferences: controller-managed fields (status, resourceVersion, generation)\n- Tracking annotation: `argocd.argoproj.io/tracking-id`\n\n## Dependencies\n\nRequires:\n- nix-50f.13 (ArgoCD easykubenix module) - ArgoCD must be deployed before Application CRs can be applied\n\nEnables:\n- nix-50f.7 (cert-manager nixidy Application) - cert-manager Application definition builds on this nixidy foundation\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n**J3 - Adoption proof**:\n1. `nix build .#nixidy-manifests-local-k3d` generates Application CRs in `./manifests/local-k3d/`\n2. Apply bootstrap Application: `kubectl apply -f ./manifests/local-k3d/bootstrap.yaml`\n3. ArgoCD successfully syncs all Phase 3 applications (Cilium, sops-operator, step-ca, ArgoCD)\n4. No resources are recreated - adoption preserves existing Helm releases\n5. `argocd app list` shows all applications Synced/Healthy\n\n**J4 - Self-management proof**:\n1. ArgoCD manages its own configuration via the argocd Application CR\n2. Changes to ArgoCD nixidy module trigger ArgoCD self-update\n\n## Integration with deployment sequence\n\nAfter Phase 3b kluctl deployment completes:\n```bash\n# Phase 3b complete (ArgoCD running via kluctl)\n# Phase 4 begins: render and apply nixidy manifests\nnix build .#nixidy-manifests-local-k3d\nkubectl apply -f ./manifests/local-k3d/bootstrap.yaml\n# ArgoCD adopts Phase 3 apps and enters self-managing state\n```\n\nThe `just` target may be extended to include Phase 4 bootstrap:\n```bash\njust k3d-down \u0026\u0026 just k3d-up \u0026\u0026 just deploy-local  # includes Phase 4 bootstrap\n```\n\n## Reference\n\nnixidy upstream: `~/projects/sciops-workspace/nixidy`\nnixidy example: `~/projects/sciops-workspace/nixidy-cluster`\n\nArgoCD adoption patterns:\n- https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/resource_tracking/\n- Tracking method: annotation (not label, to avoid namespace pollution)\n\nNote: This issue establishes the nixidy foundation.

{"id":"nix-tv8","title":"k3d + ctlptl local cluster integration","description":"Implement k3d cluster with ctlptl for local development, replacing current Incus VM approach.\n\n## Rationale\nADR-005 analysis determined that Cilium eBPF is fundamentally broken in Incus/Colima nested virtualization on ARM64. The k3d + ctlptl approach:\n- Avoids nested virtualization entirely (containers, not VMs)\n- Uses k3s distribution (matches Hetzner production)\n- Restores functional Cilium networking (limited eBPF, but functional)\n- Leverages OrbStack performance (user's Docker override)\n\n## k3d Advantages over kind\n- Production parity: k3d uses k3s (same as Hetzner production)\n- 80% faster startup than kind\n- Lower memory footprint (423-502 MiB vs kind's higher usage)\n- Native ARM64 support without emulation\n\n## Implementation\n1. Add k3d and ctlptl to dev shell (modules/dev-shell.nix)\n2. Create k3d cluster configuration:\n   - K3D_FIX_MOUNTS=1 for Cilium BPF mount propagation\n   - --flannel-backend=none for custom CNI\n   - --disable-network-policy, --disable-kube-proxy for Cilium\n   - --disable=traefik, --disable=servicelb\n   - Port mappings for API, ingress, services\n3. Integrate ctlptl YAML configuration (following Kargo patterns)\n4. Deploy Cilium via existing easykubenix modules\n5. Update workflow docs (02b-local-development-k3d.md)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- k3d cluster starts successfully on aarch64-darwin via OrbStack\n- Cilium deploys and pods reach cilium_host (resolves nix-2hd)\n- easykubenix manifests deploy via kluctl\n- kubectl access works from macOS\n- Multi-node cluster option documented\n\n## References\n- ADR-005: docs/notes/development/kubernetes/decisions/ADR-005-local-cluster-architecture-revision.md\n- Kargo patterns: ~/projects/sciops-workspace/kargo/hack/k3d/\n- nix-2hd: Cilium investigation (motivation)\n- nix-50f: Local Development Cluster epic","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"cameron.ray.smith@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-19T01:54:06.708705-05:00","created_by":"Cameron Smith","updated_at":"2026-01-19T14:51:22.2627-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-19T14:51:22.2627-05:00","close_reason":"Implemented in commits b4b3d759..83a223e9. k3d cluster with Cilium CNI operational. k3d/OrbStack eBPF accommodations: disabled kube-proxy replacement, iptables masquerade. step-ca secrets discovered as separate issue (nix-dbr).","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"nix-tv8","depends_on_id":"nix-50f","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-19T01:54:16.158121-05:00","created_by":"Cameron Smith"},{"issue_id":"nix-tv8","depends_on_id":"nix-2hd","type":"discovered-from","created_at":"2026-01-19T01:54:16.348315-05:00","created_by":"Cameron Smith"}],"comments":[{"id":17,"issue_id":"nix-tv8","author":"Cameron Smith","text":"Checkpoint: 2026-01-19 session\n\n## Done\n- k3d cluster configuration (cluster.yaml) with ctlptl\n- k3s v1.31.4 image for Cilium compatibility  \n- justfile targets (k3d-up, k3d-down, k3d-status)\n- easykubenix cluster config (default.nix)\n- kubernetes.nix flake bridge integration\n- Cilium k3d/OrbStack accommodations:\n  - kubeProxyReplacement: false (use k3s native kube-proxy)\n  - bpf.masquerade: false (use iptables masquerade)\n  - enableIPv4Masquerade: true\n\n## Discovered\n- easykubenix needed .templateignore fix (pushed to fork)\n- k3d defaulted to ancient k3s v1.21.7 without explicit image\n- Cilium kube-proxy replacement incompatible with k3d/OrbStack (BPF limits)\n- Cilium BPF masquerade requires NodePort which requires kube-proxy replacement\n\n## Remaining\n- Multi-node cluster documentation (minor)\n- step-ca secrets provisioning (separate concern, needs sops-secrets-operator or manual injection)\n\n## Learnings\n- k3d + Cilium requires significant eBPF accommodations vs production\n- ctlptl schema uses lowercase field names (k3d.v1alpha5Simple not k3dV1Alpha5Simple)\n- kluctl templateignore needed for YAML files containing Helm/Go template syntax\n\n## Verdict\nCore acceptance criteria met. k3d cluster with Cilium CNI operational.\nstep-ca blocked on secrets, not networking.","created_at":"2026-01-19T19:50:08Z"}]}
