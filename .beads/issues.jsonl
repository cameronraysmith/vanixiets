The k3d + ctlptl approach:\n- Avoids nested virtualization entirely (containers, not VMs)\n- Uses k3s distribution (matches Hetzner production)\n- Restores functional Cilium networking (limited eBPF, but functional)\n- Leverages OrbStack performance (user's Docker override)\n\n## k3d Advantages over kind\n- Production parity: k3d uses k3s (same as Hetzner production)\n- 80% faster startup than kind\n- Lower memory footprint (423-502 MiB vs kind's higher usage)\n- Native ARM64 support without emulation\n\n## Implementation\n1. Add k3d and ctlptl to dev shell (modules/dev-shell.nix)\n2. Create k3d cluster configuration:\n   - K3D_FIX_MOUNTS=1 for Cilium BPF mount propagation\n   - --flannel-backend=none for custom CNI\n   - --disable-network-policy, --disable-kube-proxy for Cilium\n   - --disable=traefik, --disable=servicelb\n   - Port mappings for API, ingress, services\n3. Integrate ctlptl YAML configuration (following Kargo patterns)\n4. Deploy Cilium via existing easykubenix modules\n5.

{"id":"nix-xa0","title":"sops-secrets-operator module refinements","description":"Issues discovered during nix-50f.8 implementation with root causes identified:\n\n## 1. CRD Not Auto-Deployed\n**Root cause:** easykubenix has includeCRDs=false by default. The sops-secrets-operator chart has CRD as symlink which Helm doesn't process reliably.\n\n**Fix:** Add importyaml for CRD:\n```nix\nimportyaml.sops-secrets-operator-crds = {\n  src = \"${sops-secrets-operator-src}/config/crd/bases/isindir.github.com_sopssecrets.yaml\";\n};\nkubernetes.apiMappings.SopsSecret = \"isindir.github.com/v1alpha3\";\nkubernetes.namespacedMappings.SopsSecret = true;\n```\n\n## 2. Deployment in Wrong Namespace  \n**Root cause:** Needs investigation - helm.releases.namespace should pass --namespace to helm template but deployment ended up in default.\n\n**Action:** Trace easykubenix chart2json.nix namespace handling. Check if namespace is being passed correctly.\n\n## 3. RBAC ClusterRoleBinding Namespace Mismatch\n**Root cause:** Consequence of #2. Chart correctly templates {{ .Release.Namespace }} but that was 'default' not 'sops-secrets-operator'.\n\n**Fix:** Resolve #2 and this fixes automatically.\n\n## 4. ca-password Secret Empty\n**Root cause:** step-ca inject.secrets creates Secret with no keys when value is empty string. step-ca expects password file to exist.\n\n**Fix:** SopsSecret should manage all step-ca secrets including password key, OR module ensures password key exists.\n\n## 5. Age Key Bootstrap Secret\n**Root cause:** No mechanism for operator bootstrap secrets in current architecture.\n\n**Options:**\n- Document manual creation (current)\n- kubernetes.resources with {{ placeholder }} syntax for kluctl substitution\n- Init job pattern\n\nReference: hetzkube patterns show Bitwarden operator + placeholder syntax for secrets.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"cameron.ray.smith@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-19T15:44:41.977256-05:00","created_by":"Cameron Smith","updated_at":"2026-01-19T16:17:08.805515-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-19T16:17:08.805515-05:00","close_reason":"Implemented in 838f90ac.
