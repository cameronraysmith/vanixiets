The goal is to replay the commits from branches `nix-btd-2-codify-worktree` and `nix-btd-3-worktree-dispatch` as linear commits on top of the hook/gitignore commits, followed by the beads closure commit.\n\nYou have access to `git-revise` which can non-interactively rewrite history. Run `git-revise --help` to understand its capabilities. It may be useful for cutting/splicing commits without interactive rebase.\n\nHowever, `git rebase --onto` with non-interactive flags may also work here since the goal is topological (removing merge commits, replaying linearly).\n\n## Constraints\n\n- Do NOT use any interactive commands (`git rebase -i`, `git add -i`, etc.) — these hang in this environment.\n- If you determine an interactive command is absolutely essential, STOP and return with that notification. Do not attempt it.\n- The rewritten history will need `git push --force-with-lease origin main` at the end since the remote has some of these commits. This is authorized for this specific operation.\n- Preserve ALL file changes — only the commit topology changes.\n- The final linear history should have the same logical commits i","created_at":"2026-02-12T07:14:05Z"}]}

{"id":"nix-d4o.6","title":"Rework adapted hooks to restore worktree support from The-Claude-Protocol","description":"The plan document (docs/notes/development/claude-code-protocol-integration.md) line 68 states 'rework for the branch-based workflow (not worktree-based)' which caused the implementing agent to strip all worktree support from adapted hooks. The design session actually concluded worktrees SHOULD be adopted following The-Claude-Protocol's .worktrees/bd-{BEAD_ID}/ pattern. Worktree compatibility was validated (absolute symlinks work, beads hooks handle worktrees, nix flakes work in worktrees).\n\nRework required in three areas:\n\n1. Update plan document: change line 68 to state worktrees ARE adopted. Remove conditional language from line 74. Add a section on the worktree workflow convention (.worktrees/bd-{BEAD_ID}/ pattern, worktree creation, lifecycle).\n\n2. Fix 3 adapted hook scripts:\n   - enforce-branch-before-edit.sh: add .worktrees/ path checks (both file_path and CWD), update denial message to guide toward worktree creation not just branch creation. Reference The-Claude-Protocol original at ~/projects/planning-workspace/The-Claude-Protocol/templates/hooks/enforce-branch-before-edit.sh lines 23-26 and 32-49.\n   - validate-completion.sh: add worktree existence verification, uncommitted changes check within worktree path. Reference original lines 75-106.\n   - memory-capture.sh: remove 'we do not use worktrees' comment (line 51), add worktree-aware source detection (CWD in .worktrees/ -\u003e supervisor). Reference original lines 91-94.\n\n3. Consider whether enforce-sequential-dispatch.sh and session-start.sh also need worktree awareness (check The-Claude-Protocol originals for worktree references in those hooks).\n\nThe adapted hooks currently live at modules/home/tools/hooks/ as writeShellApplication packages in modules/home/tools/hooks/default.nix.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"cameron.ray.smith@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-10T21:02:13.685144-05:00","created_by":"Cameron Smith","updated_at":"2026-02-10T21:34:31.143786-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-10T21:34:31.143786-05:00","close_reason":"Implemented in cbd400c.

{"id":"nix-tv8","title":"k3d + ctlptl local cluster integration","description":"Implement k3d cluster with ctlptl for local development, replacing current Incus VM approach.\n\n## Rationale\nADR-005 analysis determined that Cilium eBPF is fundamentally broken in Incus/Colima nested virtualization on ARM64. The k3d + ctlptl approach:\n- Avoids nested virtualization entirely (containers, not VMs)\n- Uses k3s distribution (matches Hetzner production)\n- Restores functional Cilium networking (limited eBPF, but functional)\n- Leverages OrbStack performance (user's Docker override)\n\n## k3d Advantages over kind\n- Production parity: k3d uses k3s (same as Hetzner production)\n- 80% faster startup than kind\n- Lower memory footprint (423-502 MiB vs kind's higher usage)\n- Native ARM64 support without emulation\n\n## Implementation\n1. Add k3d and ctlptl to dev shell (modules/dev-shell.nix)\n2. Create k3d cluster configuration:\n   - K3D_FIX_MOUNTS=1 for Cilium BPF mount propagation\n   - --flannel-backend=none for custom CNI\n   - --disable-network-policy, --disable-kube-proxy for Cilium\n   - --disable=traefik, --disable=servicelb\n   - Port mappings for API, ingress, services\n3.

{"id":"nix-xa0","title":"sops-secrets-operator module refinements","description":"Issues discovered during nix-50f.8 implementation with root causes identified:\n\n## 1. CRD Not Auto-Deployed\n**Root cause:** easykubenix has includeCRDs=false by default. The sops-secrets-operator chart has CRD as symlink which Helm doesn't process reliably.\n\n**Fix:** Add importyaml for CRD:\n```nix\nimportyaml.sops-secrets-operator-crds = {\n  src = \"${sops-secrets-operator-src}/config/crd/bases/isindir.github.com_sopssecrets.yaml\";\n};\nkubernetes.apiMappings.SopsSecret = \"isindir.github.com/v1alpha3\";\nkubernetes.namespacedMappings.SopsSecret = true;\n```\n\n## 2. Deployment in Wrong Namespace  \n**Root cause:** Needs investigation - helm.releases.namespace should pass --namespace to helm template but deployment ended up in default.\n\n**Action:** Trace easykubenix chart2json.nix namespace handling. Check if namespace is being passed correctly.\n\n## 3. RBAC ClusterRoleBinding Namespace Mismatch\n**Root cause:** Consequence of #2. Chart correctly templates {{ .Release.Namespace }} but that was 'default' not 'sops-secrets-operator'.\n\n**Fix:** Resolve #2 and this fixes automatically.\n\n## 4. ca-password Secret Empty\n**Root cause:** step-ca inject.secrets creates Secret with no keys when value is empty string. step-ca expects password file to exist.\n\n**Fix:** SopsSecret should manage all step-ca secrets including password key, OR module ensures password key exists.\n\n## 5. Age Key Bootstrap Secret\n**Root cause:** No mechanism for operator bootstrap secrets in current architecture.\n\n**Options:**\n- Document manual creation (current)\n- kubernetes.resources with {{ placeholder }} syntax for kluctl substitution\n- Init job pattern\n\nReference: hetzkube patterns show Bitwarden operator + placeholder syntax for secrets.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"cameron.ray.smith@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-19T15:44:41.977256-05:00","created_by":"Cameron Smith","updated_at":"2026-01-19T16:17:08.805515-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-19T16:17:08.805515-05:00","close_reason":"Implemented in 838f90ac.
